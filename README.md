#Digital System Design and Generation - System Verilog Projects

This repository contains 3 digital design projects. Each folder contains the problem statement and the reports for the projects.



The projects are system verilog codes for ASIC design of modules as described below.
A brief description of the projects is given below:
1. Multiply and Accumulate - This is a basic multiply and accumulation unit that implements the equation f= f +a*b. The project is just for exploring system verilog and getting familiar with concepts of ASIC design. The effects of pipeling - with different stages and at different places are studied and analysis of clock and power is done. A testbench is also implemented which consists of a C file that generates test case inputs that are then fed into the design developed. The C file also generates the exepcted output values for the sample input given. The results from the design are then compared with the expected output values to verify operation of the design.\n\n

2. Matrix Vector Multiplication -
